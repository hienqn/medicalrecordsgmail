Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.

To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.

Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n",

Secondly, to act and vote for us as\r\naforesaid in the choice of all general officers, as need shall require.\r\nThirdly, if the General Court shall consist of but ten men for each\r\ntown, then you are to act accordingly for this town; and if the General\r\nCourt shall be reduced into a fewer number, which, for divers\r\nconsiderations, we conceive may be for the best, then we give you full\r\npower to choose from among yourselves, such a number of our loving\r\nneighbors as shall answer the same figure, unto whom, being orderly\r\nchosen by you, we do give you power to transfer this our commission,\r\ngiving of them full power to act and vote for us, the inhabitants of\r\nthis plantation, in all general affairs, and for the settling of the\r\nisland in peace and union, and for all matters that shall concern this\r\nparticular town, desiring a careful respect unto these ensuing\r\ninstructions. But, if the Court shall consist of ten of each town, then\r\nour desires are, that this our commission, with the ensuing\r\ninstructions, may remain entire in your hands.\r\n\r\nâFirst. That we may have a true copy of our charter assigned unto us by\r\nthe General Court, for the proper use of our plantation.\r\n\r\nâSecondly. We do voluntarily and are freely willing to receive and be\r\ngoverned by the laws of England, together with the way of administration\r\nof them, so far as the nature and constitution of this plantation will\r\nadmit, desiring, so far as possibly may be, to hold a correspondency\r\nwith the whole colony in that model that hath been lately shown unto us\r\nby our worthy friends of the island, if the General Court shall complete\r\nand confirm the same, or any other model as the General Court shall\r\nagree upon according to our charter.\r\n\r\nâThirdly.

Ninigret,\r\nthe Niantick sachem, had made war with the Indians of Long Island,[290]\r\nand was supposed to be in alliance with the Dutch at New-York. The\r\ncommissioners of the united colonies sent a considerable force against\r\nNinigret, under the command of Major Willard, of Massachusetts, but they\r\nreturned without success, the sachem and his warriors having taken\r\nrefuge in a swamp. The real cause, perhaps, why the war was not\r\nvigorously waged, was, that Massachusetts was opposed to hostilities,\r\nand with a wisdom and humanity which honored her rulers, prevented at\r\nthis time, as she had done on a former occasion, a general war with the\r\nnatives.[291] We may hope, that the admirable letter of Mr. Williams had\r\nsome effect in producing this pacific temper:\r\n\r\n                                 â_Providence, 5, 8, 54, (so called.)_\r\n\r\n  âMuch honored Sirs,\r\n\r\n  âI truly wish you peace, and pray your gentle acceptance of a word,\r\n  I hope not unreasonable.\r\n\r\n  âWe have in these parts a sound of your meditations of war against\r\n  these natives, amongst whom we dwell. I consider that war is one of\r\n  those three great, sore plagues, with which it pleaseth God to\r\n  affect the sons of men. I consider, also, that I refused, lately,\r\n  many offers in my native country, out of a sincere desire to seek\r\n  the good and peace of this.\r\n\r\n  âI remember, that upon the express advice of your ever honored Mr.\r\n  Winthrop, deceased,[292] I first adventured to begin a plantation\r\n  among the thickest of these barbarians.\r\n\r\n  âThat in the Pequod wars, it pleased your honored government to\r\n  employ me in the hazardous and weighty service of negotiating a\r\n  league between yourselves and the Narragansets, when the Pequod\r\n  messengers, who sought the Narragansetsâ league against the English,\r\n  had almost ended that my work and life together.\r\n\r\n  âThat at the subscribing of that solemn league, which, by the mercy\r\n  of the Lord, I had procured with the Narragansets, your government\r\n  was pleased to send unto me the copy of it, subscribed by all hands\r\n  there, which yet I keep as a monument and a testimony of peace and\r\n  faithfulness between you both.\r\n\r\n  âThat, since that time, it hath pleased the Lord so to order it,\r\n  that I have been more or less interested and used in all your great\r\n  transactions of war or peace, between the English and the natives,\r\n  and have not spared purse, nor pains, nor hazards, (very many\r\n  times,) that the whole land, English and natives, might sleep in\r\n  peace securely.\r\n\r\n  âThat in my last negotiations in England, with the Parliament,\r\n  Council of State, and his Highness,[293] I have been forced to be\r\n  known so much, that if I should be silent, I should not only betray\r\n  mine own peace and yours, but also should be false to their\r\n  honorable and princely names, whose loves and affections, as well as\r\n  their supreme authority, are not a little concerned in the peace or\r\n  war of this country.\r\n\r\n  âAt my last departure for England, I was importuned by the\r\n  Narraganset sachems, and especially by Ninigret, to present their\r\n  petition to the high sachems of England, that they might not be\r\n  forced from their religion, and, for not changing their religion, be\r\n  invaded by war; for they said they were daily visited with\r\n  threatenings by Indians that came from about the Massachusetts, that\r\n  if they would not pray, they should be destroyed by war. With this\r\n  their petition I acquainted, in private discourses, divers of the\r\n  chief of our nation, and especially his Highness, who, in many\r\n  discourses I had with him, never expressed the least tittle of\r\n  displeasure, as hath been here reported, but, in the midst of\r\n  disputes, ever expressed a high spirit of love and gentleness, and\r\n  was often pleased to please himself with very many questions, and my\r\n  answers, about the Indian affairs of this country; and, after all\r\n  hearing of yourself and us, it hath pleased his Highness and his\r\n  Council to grant, amongst other favors to this colony, some\r\n  expressly concerning the very Indians, the native inhabitants of\r\n  this jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n  âI, therefore, humbly offer to your prudent and impartial view,\r\n  first, these two considerable terms, it pleased the Lord to use to\r\n  all that profess his name (Rom. 12: 18,) if it be possible, and all\r\n  men.\r\n\r\n  âI never was against the righteous use of the civil sword of men or\r\n  nations, but yet since all men of conscience or prudence ply to\r\n  windward, to maintain their wars to be defensive, (as did both King\r\n  and Scotch, and English, and Irish too, in the late wars,) I humbly\r\n  pray your consideration, whether it be not only possible, but very\r\n  easy, to live and die in peace with all the natives of this country.",

Quoth she \"Remaineth now only one other thing to\r\nbe done; thou must shave his beard and make him a smooth o'\r\nface.\"[FN#646] So the maiden went back and told him what her mistress\r\nhad bidden her do; and my brother (the blockhead!) said to her, \"How\r\nshall I do what will disgrace me before the folk?\" But the old woman\r\nsaid, \"She would do on this wise only that thou mayst be as a beardless\r\nyouth and that no hair be left on thy face to scratch and prick her\r\ndelicate cheeks; for indeed she is passionately in love with thee. So\r\nbe patient and thou shalt attain thine object.\" My brother was patient\r\nand did her bidding and let shave off his beard and, when he was\r\nbrought back to the lady, lo! he appeared dyed red as to his eyebrows,\r\nplucked of both mustachios, shorn of his beard, rouged on both cheeks.\r\nAt first she was affrighted at him; then she made mockery of him and,\r\nlaughing till she fell upon her back, said, \"O my lord, thou hast\r\nindeed won my heart by thy good nature!\" Then she conjured him, by her\r\nlife, to stand up and dance, and he arose, and capered about, and there\r\nwas not a cushion in the house but she threw it at his head, and in\r\nlike manner did all her women who also kept pelting him with oranges\r\nand lemons and citrons till he fell down senseless from the cuffing on\r\nthe nape of the neck, the pillowing and the fruit pelting. \"Now thou\r\nhast attained thy wish,\" said the old woman when he came round; \"there\r\nare no more blows in store for thee and there remaineth but one little\r\nthing to do. It is her wont, when she is in her cups, to let no one\r\nhave her until she put off her dress and trousers and remain stark\r\nnaked.[FN#647] Then she will bid thee doff thy clothes and run; and she\r\nwill run before thee as if she were flying from thee; and do thou\r\nfollow her from place to place till thy prickle stands at fullest\r\npoint, when she will yield to thee;\"[FN#648] adding, \"Strip off thy\r\nclothes at once.\" So he rose, well nigh lost in ecstasy and, doffing\r\nhis raiment, showed himself mother naked.âAnd Shahrazad perceived the\r\ndawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\r\n\r\nWhen it was the Thirty-second Night,\r\n\r\n\r\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old",

Then he asked\r\nmy brother, \"What dost thou want, O blind man?\" and he answered,\r\n\"Something for the Almighty's sake.\" \"Allah open for thee some other\r\ndoor!\" \"O thou! why not say so when I was below stairs?\" \"O cadger, why\r\nnot answer me when I first called to thee?\" \"And what meanest thou to\r\ndo for me now?\" \"There is nothing in the house to give thee.\" \"Then\r\ntake me down the stair.\" \"The path is before thee.\" So my brother rose\r\nand made his way downstairs, till he came within twenty steps of the\r\ndoor, when his foot slipped and he rolled to the bottom and broke his\r\nhead. Then he went out, unknowing whither to turn, and presently fell\r\nin with two other blind men, companions of his, who said to him, \"What\r\ndidst thou gain to day?\" He told them what had befallen him and added,\r\n\"O my brothers, I wish to take some of the money in my hands and\r\nprovide myself with it.\" Now the master of the house had followed him\r\nand was listening to what they said; but neither my brother nor his\r\ncomrades knew of this. So my brother went to his lodging and sat down\r\nto await his companions, and the house owner entered after him without\r\nbeing perceived. When the other blind men arrived, my brother said to\r\nthem, \"Bolt the door and search the house lest any stranger have\r\nfollowed us.\" The man, hearing this, caught hold of a cord that hung\r\nfrom the ceiling and clung to it, whilst they went round about the\r\nhouse and searched but found no one. So they came back, and, sitting\r\nbeside my brother, brought out their money which they counted and lo!\r\nit was twelve thousand dirhams. Each took what he wanted and they\r\nburied the rest in a corner of the room. Then they set on food and sat\r\ndown, to eat. Presently my brother, hearing a strange pair of jaws\r\nmunching by his side,[FN#651] said to his friends, \"There is a stranger\r\namongst us;\" and, putting forth his hand, caught hold of that of the\r\nhouse master. Thereupon all fell on him and beat him;[FN#652] and when\r\ntired of belabouring him they shouted, \"O ye Moslems! a thief is come\r\nin to us, seeking to take our money!\" A crowd gathered around them,\r\nwhereupon the intruder hung on to them; and complained with them as\r\nthey complained, and, shutting his eyes like them, so that none might\r\ndoubt his blindness, cried out, \"O Moslems, I take refuge with Allah\r\nand the Governor, for I have a matter to make known to him!\" Suddenly\r\nup came the watch and, laying hands on the whole lot (my brother being\r\namongst them), drove them[FN#653] to the Governor's who set them before\r\nhim and asked, \"What news with you?\" Quoth the intruder, \"Look and find\r\nout for thyself, not a word shall be wrung from us save by torture, so\r\nbegin by beating me and after me beat this man our leader.\"[FN#654] And\r\nhe pointed to my brother. So they threw the man at full length and gave\r\nhim four hundred sticks on his backside. The beating pained him,\r\nwhereupon he opened one eye and, as they redoubled their blows, he\r\nopened the other eye. When the Governor saw this he said to him, \"What\r\nhave we here, O accursed?\"; whereto he replied, \"Give me the seal-ring\r\nof pardon! We four have shammed blind, and we impose upon people that\r\nwe may enter houses and look upon the unveiled faces of the women and\r\ncontrive for their corruption. In this way we have gotten great gain\r\nand our store amounts to twelve thousand dirhams. Said I to my company,\r\n'Give me my share, three thousand;' but they rose and beat me and took\r\naway my money, and I seek refuge with Allah and with thee; better thou\r\nhave my share than they. So, if thou wouldst know the truth of my\r\nwords, beat one and every of the others more than thou hast beaten me,\r\nand he will surely open his eyes.\" The Governor gave orders for the\r\nquestion to begin with my brother, and they bound him to the whipping\r\npost,[FN#655] and the Governor said, \"O scum of the earth, do ye abuse\r\nthe gracious gifts of Allah and make as if ye were blind!\" \"Allah!\r\nAllah!\" cried my brother, \"by Allah, there is none among us who can\r\nsee.\" Then they beat him till he swooned away and the Governor cried,\r\n\"Leave him till he come to and then beat him again.\" After this he\r\ncaused each of the companions to receive more than three hundred\r\nsticks, whilst the sham Abraham kept saying to them \"Open your eyes or\r\nyou will be beaten afresh.\" At last the man said to the Governor,\r\n\"Dispatch some one with me to bring thee the money; for these fellows\r\nwill not open their eyes, lest they incur disgrace before the folk.\" So\r\nthe Governor sent to fetch the money and gave the man his pretended\r\nshare, three thousand dirhams; and, keeping the rest for himself,\r\nbanished the three blind men from the city. But I, O Commander of the\r\nFaithful, went out and overtaking my brother questioned him of his\r\ncase; whereupon he told me of what I have told thee; so I brought him\r\nsecretly into the city, and appointed him (in the strictest privacy) an\r\nallowance for meat and drink! The Caliph laughed at my story and said,\r\n\"Give him a gift and let him go;\" but I said, \"By Allah! I will take\r\nnaught till I have made known to the Commander of the Faithful what\r\ncame to pass with the rest of my brothers; for truly I am a man of few\r\nwords and spare of speech.\" Then the Caliph gave ear to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Barberâs Tale of his Fourth Brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow as for my fourth brother, O Commander of the Faithful, Al-Kuz\r\nal-aswÃ¡ni, or the long necked Gugglet hight, from his brimming over\r\nwith words, the same who was blind of one eye, he became a butcher in\r\nBaghdad and he sold flesh and fattened rams; and great men and rich\r\nbought their meat of him, so that he amassed much wealth and got him\r\ncattle and houses. He fared thus a long while, till one day, as he was\r\nsitting in his shop, there came up an old man and long o' the beard,\r\nwho laid down some silver and said, \"Give me meat for this.\" He gave\r\nhim his money s worth of flesh and the oldster went his ways. My\r\nbrother examined the Shaykh's silver, and, seeing that the dirhams were\r\nwhite and bright, he set them in a place apart. The greybeard continued\r\nto return to the shop regularly for five months, and my brother ceased\r\nnot to lay up all the coin he received from him in its own box. At last\r\nhe thought to take out the money to buy sheep; so he opened the box and\r\nfound in it nothing, save bits of white paper cut round to look like\r\ncoin;[FN#656] so he buffeted his face and cried aloud till the folk\r\ngathered about him, whereupon he told them his tale which made them\r\nmarvel exceedingly. Then he rose as was his wont, and slaughtering a\r\nram hung it up inside his shop; after which he cut off some of the\r\nflesh, and hanging it outside kept saying to himself, \"O Allah, would\r\nthe ill omened old fellow but come!\" And an hour had not passed before\r\nthe Shaykh came with his silver in hand; where upon my brother rose and\r\ncaught hold of him calling out, \"Come aid me, O Moslems, and learn my\r\nstory with this villain!\" When the old man heard this, he quietly said\r\nto him, \"Which will be the better for thee, to let go of me or to be\r\ndisgraced by me amidst the folk?\" \"In what wilt thou disgrace me?\" \"In\r\nthat thou sellest man's flesh for mutton!\" \"Thou liest, thou accursed!\"\r\n\"Nay, he is the accursed who hath a man hanging up by way of meat in\r\nhis shop. If the matter be as thou sayest, I give thee lawful leave to\r\ntake my money and my life.\" Then the old man cried out aloud, \"Ho, ye\r\npeople! if you would prove the truth of my words, enter this man's\r\nshop.\" The folk rushed in and found that the ram was become a dead\r\nman[FN#657] hung up for sale. So they set upon my brother crying out,\r\n\"O Infidel! O villain!\"; and his best friends fell to cuffing and\r\nkicking him and kept saying, \"Dost thou make us eat flesh of the sons\r\nof Adam?\" Furthermore, the old man struck him on the eye and put it\r\nout. Then they carried the carcass, with the throat cut, before the\r\nChief of the city watch, to whom the old man said, \"O Emir, this fellow\r\nbutchers men and sells their flesh for mutton and we have brought him\r\nto thee; so arise and execute the judgments of Allah (to whom be honour\r\nand glory!).\" My brother would have defended himself, but the Chief\r\nrefused to hear him and sentenced him to receive five hundred sticks\r\nand to forfeit the whole of his property. And, indeed, had it not been\r\nfor that same property which he expended in bribes, they would have\r\nsurely slain him. Then the Chief banished him from Baghdad; and my\r\nbrother fared forth at a venture, till he came to a great town, where\r\nhe thought it best to set up as a cobbler; so he opened a shop and sat\r\nthere doing what he could for his livelihood. One day, as he went forth\r\non his business, he heard the distant tramp of horses and, asking the\r\ncause, was told that the King was going out to hunt and course; so my\r\nbrother stopped to look at the fine suite. It so fortuned that the\r\nKing's eye met my brother's; whereupon the King hung down his head and\r\nsaid, \"I seek refuge with Allah from the evil of this day!\";[FN#658]\r\nand turned the reins of his steed and returned home with all his\r\nretinue. Then he gave orders to his guards, who seized my brother and\r\nbeat him with a beating so painful that he was well nigh dead; and my\r\nbrother knew not what could be the cause of his maltreatment, after\r\nwhich he returned to his place in sorriest plight. Soon afterwards he\r\nwent to one of the King's household and related what had happened to\r\nhim; and the man laughed till he fell upon his back and cried, \"O\r\nbrother mine, know that the King cannot bear to look at a monocular,\r\nespecially if he be blind of the right eye, in which case he doth not\r\nlet him go without killing him.\" When my brother heard this, he\r\nresolved to fly from that city; so he went forth from it to another\r\nwherein none knew him and there he abode a long while. One day, being\r\nfull of sorrowful thought for what had befallen him, he sallied out to\r\nsolace himself; and, as he was walking along, he heard the distant\r\ntramp of horses behind him and said, \"The judgement of Allah is upon\r\nme!\" and looked about for a hiding place but found none. At last he saw\r\na closed door which he pushed hard: it yielded. and he entered a long\r\ngallery in which he took refuge, but hardly had he done so, when two\r\nmen set upon him crying out, \"Allah be thanked for having delivered\r\nthee into our hands, O enemy of God! These three nights thou hast\r\nrobbed us of our rest and sleep, and verily thou hast made us taste of\r\nthe death cup.\" My brother asked, \"O folk, what ails you?\"; and they\r\nanswered, \"Thou givest us the change and goest about to disgrace us and\r\nplannest some plot to cut the throat of the house master! Is it not\r\nenough that thou hast brought him to beggary, thou and thy fellows? But\r\nnow give us up the knife wherewith thou threatenest us every night.\"\r\nThen they searched him and found in his waist belt the knife used for\r\nhis shoe leather; and he said, \"O people, have the fear of Allah before\r\nyour eyes and maltreat me not, for know that my story is a right\r\nstrange!\" \"And what is thy story?\" said they: so he told them what had\r\nbefallen him, hoping they would let him go; however they paid no heed\r\nto what he said and, instead of showing some regard, beat him\r\ngrievously and tore off his clothes: then, finding on his sides the\r\nscars of beating with rods, they said, \"O accursed! these marks are the\r\nmanifest signs of thy guilt!\" They carried him before the Governor,\r\nwhilst he said to himself, \"I am now punished for my sins and none can\r\ndeliver me save Allah Almighty!\" The Governor addressing my brother\r\nasked him, \"O villain, what led thee to enter their house with\r\nintention to murther?\"; and my brother answered, \"I conjure thee by\r\nAllah, O Emir, hear my words and be not hasty in condemning me!\" But\r\nthe Governor cried, \"Shall we listen to the words of a robber who hath\r\nbeggared these people, and who beareth on his back the scar of his\r\nstripes?\" adding, \"They surely had not done this to thee, save for some\r\ngreat crime.\" So he sentenced him to receive an hundred cuts with the\r\nscourge, after which they set him on a camel and paraded him about the\r\ncity, proclaiming, \"This is the requital and only too little to requite\r\nhim who breaketh into people's houses.\" Then they thrust him out of the\r\ncity, and my brother wandered at random, till I heard what had befallen\r\nhim; and, going in search of him, questioned him of his case; so he\r\nacquainted me with his story and all his mischances, and I carried him\r\nsecretly to the city where I made him an allowance for his meat and\r\ndrink. Then the Caliph gave ear to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Barberâs Tale of his Fifth Brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy fifth brother, Al-NashshÃ¡r,[FN#659] the Babbler, the same who was\r\ncropped of both ears, O Commander of the Faithful, was an asker wont to\r\nbeg of folk by night and live on their alms by day. Now when our\r\nfather, who was an old man well stricken in years sickened and died, he\r\nleft us seven hundred dirhams whereof each son took his hundred; but,\r\nas my fifth brother received his portion, he was perplexed and knew not\r\nwhat to do with it. While in this uncertainty he bethought him to lay\r\nit out on glass ware of all sorts and turn an honest penny on its\r\nprice. So he bought an hundred dirhams worth of verroterie and, putting\r\nit into a big tray, sat down to sell it on a bench at the foot of a\r\nwall against which he leant back. As he sat with the tray before him he\r\nfell to musing and said to himself, \"Know, O my good Self, that the\r\nhead of my wealth, my principal invested in this glass ware, is an\r\nhundred dirhams. I will assuredly sell it for two hundred with which I",

I bivouacked on the hill upon\r\n      which the Connaught Rangersâ picquets are south of Three\r\n      Tree Hill.\r\n\r\n        The first shots were fired at 3.40 A.M.\r\n\r\n        The valley between my position and Spion Kop, and also\r\n      the top of that feature itself, was enveloped in mist\r\n      until about 8 A.M., when it could be seen that our force\r\n      held the schanzes on the summit. Shortly after it was\r\n      seen to be exposed to a frontal fire from rifles, and to\r\n      shell fire from its left front.\r\n\r\n        In accordance with orders communicated to me by you, to\r\n      send a battalion to reinforce, a signal message was sent\r\n      to the Imperial Light Infantry, which occupied a covering\r\n      position towards Wrightâs Farm, to proceed at once to\r\n      support, moving by the right flank of the kop. The 2nd\r\n      Battalion Dorsetshire Regiment was ordered to the place\r\n      vacated by the Imperial Light Horse.\r\n\r\n        The position of Spion Kop was now seen to be exposed\r\n      to a cross fire of artillery, and by your instructions I\r\n      sent the Middlesex Regiment in support.\r\n\r\n        About 11.10 A.M., in consequence of the regrettable\r\n      news about General Woodgate, at your order I proceeded\r\n      to the kop myself. On arrival there, I found the track\r\n      leading up very much congested, and, from information\r\n      received, I formed the opinion that too many men were\r\n      getting into the trenches and stone cover above, and\r\n      becoming exposed to the artillery fire; I accordingly\r\n      checked reinforcements. Soon after this, on my way\r\n      up, an urgent message was received from Colonel Hill,\r\n      who commanded at this time on the right, calling for\r\n      reinforcements, as his line had actually fallen back\r\n      before, and lost some prisoners to the Boers, who were\r\n      pressing on in front. I accordingly sent up the rest of\r\n      the Imperial Light Infantry available.\r\n\r\n        I now met Major Bayly, a Staff Officer, from the 4th\r\n      Brigade, who informed me that an urgent message for help\r\n      had been received from Colonel Crofton, who commanded on\r\n      Spion Kop after General Woodgate was wounded. General\r\n      Lyttelton had accordingly despatched the Scottish Rifles\r\n      as an actual reinforcement, and a battalion of the Kingâs\r\n      Royal Rifles against the hill to the north-west of Spion\r\n      Kop. It was on the further slope of this hill that one of\r\n      the Vickers-Maxim guns was placed. (This battalion worked\r\n      its way some distance up the hill, but its action did not\r\n      materially affect the situation.)\r\n\r\n        I now again received an urgent appeal for support, this\r\n      time for the centre and left. I sent the Scottish Rifles.\r\n\r\n        I now had only as a reserve Bethuneâs Mounted Infantry\r\n      and the Dorsetshire Regiment. These I retained and they\r\n      were not engaged at the actual front.\r\n\r\n        The shell fire was most galling, and was aimed not\r\n      only at the summit, but at the crest of the spur leading\r\n      up, along which reinforcements and parties bringing back\r\n      wounded had to pass. The fire came--\r\n\r\n        1. From field guns firing shrapnel and common shell,\r\n      situated, as I endeavoured to point out in a signal\r\n      message to you, north-west of our position.\r\n\r\n        2. From a Vickers-Maxim, in about the same direction.\r\n\r\n        3. From a similar gun to the north-east.\r\n\r\n        All these were beyond the effective rifle fire, and\r\n      our supporting artillery on and about Three Tree Hill\r\n      and on the Dragoonâs Maxim position apparently could\r\n      not see them; consequently they poured, unchecked, an\r\n      uninterrupted cross fire on to our position from about 8\r\n      A.M. till dark--ten hours.\r\n\r\n        Losses were very heavy, owing to the numbers\r\n      necessarily assembled to hold back the Boer frontal\r\n      attack, established under cover, and in which they showed\r\n      gallantry in pushing forward to our lines. Colonel\r\n      Crofton was now reported wounded, and the command of the\r\n      troops in front devolved on Colonel Hill, Commanding 10th\r\n      Brigade.\r\n\r\n        So the situation continued until 6 P.M., when I wrote\r\n      a report and despatched it to you by Colonel Morris,\r\n      A.A.G. (I request that this document, to save labour,\r\n      may be attached). I first showed this to Colonel Hill,\r\n      and he concurred, even taking exception to my reference\r\n      to a retirement. I had no doubt that the infantry, which\r\n      had so gallantly held its own all day, would be able to\r\n      continue to do so when the shell fire abated at nightfall.\r\n\r\n        I accordingly went back to my reserves, having\r\n      personally handed over command at the summit to Colonel\r\n      Hill.\r\n\r\n        About 9.30 P.M., in consequence of your orders, I left\r\n      for your camp, leaving a Staff Officer (Captain Phillips)\r\n      behind. The narrative must now be his.\r\n\r\n        About 11.30 P.M. this officer, who was sleeping, was\r\n      awakened by the sound of men moving, and found a general\r\n      retirement proceeding.\r\n\r\n        He allowed no one to pass after this, stopped the\r\n      Scottish Rifles, and collected a large number of\r\n      stragglers of the Dorset, Middlesex, and Imperial Light\r\n      Infantry. Bethuneâs Mounted Infantry and the bulk of the\r\n      Dorsets remained in position as posted in support to the\r\n      front line. The other corps had gone down the hill.\r\n\r\n        He then published memorandum attached,[19] to all\r\n      commanders, except Lieut.-Colonel Thorneycroft, who had\r\n      gone on; but they did not act upon it, urging that they\r\n      had had distinct orders from Lieut.-Colonel Thorneycroft,\r\n      who, as far as I knew, was only assisting Colonel Crofton\r\n      in a portion of the front line, to retire.\r\n\r\n        We now held the spur to within about 300 yards of the\r\n      summit, but the summit itself was evacuated. Signal\r\n      communication could not be established at the moment, as\r\n      the lamp which the signalling officer counted upon ran\r\n      out of oil, and some time was lost in obtaining another.\r\n\r\n        About 1.30 A.M. a person, not by his speech an\r\n      Englishman, was brought in on suspicion by a picquet. He\r\n      made a statement to the effect that a naval gun would\r\n      shortly be brought up, and requested that it might not be\r\n      fired on. This was the first intimation of any naval gun\r\n      coming to Spion Kop.\r\n\r\n        About 2.20 A.M. a naval officer reported that he\r\n      had one 12-pr. gun below Spion Kop, near the donga on\r\n      the west. He said he had orders to take this up to\r\n      the summit. When asked whether he could do so before\r\n      daylight, he said he could not. As it would be impossible\r\n      to move the gun in any line after daybreak, on account\r\n      of hostile fire, he was told to stand by in a place of\r\n      safety. Signalling communication was now opened, and the\r\n      attached message[20] sent.\r\n\r\n        As Captain Phillips got no instructions, about 2.30\r\n      A.M. he ordered vehicles back to a place of safety.\r\n      All regimental wagons had been sent across by the\r\n      Deputy-Assistant Adjutant-General (B), 5th Division.\r\n\r\n        Shortly after 4 A.M., there still being no orders, and\r\n      a mass of transport, small-arm ammunition carts, &c.,\r\n      at the donga, steps were taken to cover this passage,\r\n      and, with the concurrence of the Officer Commanding\r\n      Dorsetshire Regiment, and Officer Commanding Scottish\r\n      Rifles, certain dispositions were made with the latter\r\n      battalion and about half the former. The other half of\r\n      the Dorsetshire Regiment were employed in carrying away a\r\n      large number of boxes (about 80) of small-arm ammunition,\r\n      brought back from the front and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n        The Imperial Light Infantry, Middlesex, and\r\n      Thorneycroftâs had apparently gone home. Bethuneâs were\r\n      dismissed.\r\n\r\n        It was now light, and Boer âsnipingâ commenced. Captain\r\n      Phillips reported to me at the donga, about 4.45 A.M.,\r\n      when I was in possession of your order as to the pontoon\r\n      crossing.\r\n\r\n                              TALBOT COKE, _Major-General,\r\n                                    Commanding Right Attack_.}}\r\n\r\n\r\n                               K\r\n\r\n                         {{CASUALTIES\r\n\r\n  +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------+\r\n  |            |                |     Officers    |       Men          |\r\n  |   Date     |      ----      +-----------------+--------------------+",

The General proposes to effect the passage of the River Tugela,\r\n  in the neighbourhood of Potgieterâs Drift, with a view to the\r\n  relief of Ladysmith.\r\n\r\n  2. Forces (already detailed) will be left at Chieveley and Frere to\r\n  hold these points, while the remainder of the army is operating on\r\n  the enemyâs right flank.\r\n\r\n  3. Springfield will be seized and occupied, and the march of the\r\n  main body and supplies to that point will be covered by a force\r\n  encamped about Pretorius Farm.\r\n\r\n  4. With reference to Field Orders, dated 8th instant, paragraph 2\r\n  (_a_), the primary duty of Major-General Hildyardâs column is to\r\n  protect the march of the troops from Frere to Springfield during\r\n  the formation of a supply depÃ´t at Springfield, but he will also\r\n  operate so as to induce the enemy to believe that our intention is\r\n  to cross the River Tugela at Porritâs Drift.\r\n\r\n  5. As stated in paragraph 2 (_b_) and (_c_) of the Field Order\r\n  above quoted, the remainder of Lieut.-General Cleryâs force will\r\n  encamp south of Pretorius Farm. Major-General Hart will, under\r\n  General Cleryâs orders, assist in every way the supply columns\r\n  as they pass his camp, and he will also be prepared to support\r\n  Major-General Hildyard, if necessary.\r\n\r\n  6. On the afternoon of the 10th instant General Clery will send\r\n  a sufficient force from the Mounted Brigade, with Artillery, to\r\n  reconnoitre, and, if possible, occupy Springfield.\r\n\r\n  7. The force under General Warrenâs command (Field Order, dated\r\n  8th instant, paragraph 3) will reach Springfield on the morning of\r\n  the 11th instant, in support of the mounted troops referred to in\r\n  paragraph 6 of this order.\r\n\r\n  8. The General Commanding-in-Chief will proceed to Springfield on\r\n  the 11th instant.\r\n\r\nBetween 10th and 13th January the whole Natal Field Force, except\r\nthe 5th Brigade covering Colenso, was in motion from Chieveley,\r\nFrere, and Estcourt, concentrating on Springfield within five miles\r\nof Potgieterâs Drift (Spearmanâs or Mount Alice). This position was\r\nseized by the cavalry on 11th January, on which day General Buller\r\ntelegraphed home that he had occupied the south bank of the Tugela at\r\nPotgieterâs Drift, and seized the pont, that the river was in flood,\r\nand the enemy strongly intrenched four and a half miles to the north.\r\n\r\nThe objective was the advance to Ladysmith by forcing the passage\r\nof the Tugela at Potgieterâs, and, with this in view, maps of the\r\ncountry about the drift were issued, with an account of the road\r\nfrom Potgieterâs to Ladysmith. Upon reconnoitring the Boer positions\r\non the hills in front of Potgieterâs Sir Redvers Buller, however,\r\ncame to the conclusion that they were too strong to be taken by\r\ndirect attack, and on 14th January he directed Sir Charles Warren to\r\nreconnoitre Trichardâs Drift, some six miles higher up the river to\r\nthe westward, with a view to the possibility of crossing there and\r\nadvancing to the west of Spion Kop and getting round to the north of\r\nthat hill.\r\n\r\nOn 15th January the following secret orders were issued by Sir R.\r\nBuller to Sir C. Warren:--\r\n\r\n  1. The enemyâs position in front of Potgieterâs Drift seems to me\r\n  to be too strong to be taken by direct attack.\r\n\r\n  2. I intend to try and turn it by sending a force across the Tugela\r\n  from near Trichardâs Drift, and up to the west of Spion Kop.\r\n\r\n  3. You will have command of that force, which will consist of the\r\n  11th Brigade of your Division, your Brigade Division, Royal Field\r\n  Artillery, and General Cleryâs Division complete, and all the\r\n  mounted troops except 400.",

It was a\r\nsingular coincidence to see us shaking hands and offering cigars to men\r\nwhose duty it was an hour before to shoot us. Everything went off very\r\npleasantly except with the poor, distressed horses, who had to run over\r\ndeep sand. After the Spanish Governor and his officers had partaken of a\r\nplentiful collation under a large marquee, they took their departure, and\r\nwe gave them three cheers. We at length received our rudder from the hands\r\nof the dockyard mateys. They had made a good job of it, and it answered\r\nadmirably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                OFF BREST.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Return under jury-masts to EnglandâArrive at SpitheadâThe admiral,\r\n          the middy, and the dirkâJoin H.M.S. _Diamond_ as first\r\n    lieutenantâAttached to Lord St. Vincentâs fleet off BrestâA change\r\n          of captainsâWeary waiting for an enemy who never came.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after we sailed, with three other line of battle ships, under\r\njury-masts, for old England. On our passage we spoke a frigate, who\r\ninformed us that Sir Richard Strachan had taken the four sail of the line\r\nwhich had escaped from the French fleet. We were delighted as well as\r\nâDicky Strong,â and gave three hearty cheers. On the eighth day we arrived\r\nat Spithead, and were cheered by all the ships lying there, which we\r\nreturned. Some of the fleet had, we thought, made rather a show of their\r\nshot-holes, but our commodore declared that âgood wine needed no bush.â\r\nOur shot-holes, of which we had a good share, were painted over and not\r\nperceptible at any distance. The captain left us, and was heartily cheered\r\nas he left the ship. As soon as we were in the harbour I had permission\r\nfrom the Admiralty to return home for a month.\r\n\r\nI found my sweetest half (for I had, without knowing why or wherefore,\r\nbecome a Benedict) in much anxiety, as our ship had been reported lost.\r\nShe put into my arms a dear little black-eyed girl, who was born a week\r\nafter the action. After spending three delightful weeks, the happiest of\r\nthe happy, I tore myself away. On my rejoining the ship I found her in\r\ndock, and all the crew on board a hulk. I now became commanding officer,\r\nas the first lieutenant had leave of absence. I have here to remark that\r\nforty seamen and ten marines had leave to go to their families and friends\r\nfor three weeks or a month, according to the distance, and out of six\r\nhundred men only one desertion occurred. I mention this circumstance to\r\nprove that seamen, when they become accustomed to a man-of-war, have no\r\ndislike to her discipline, provided they are properly encouraged when\r\ndeserving, and the cat is only used when it is absolutely necessary, which\r\nwas the case in our ship. Seamen are too valuable to be ill used.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Montague was the commander-in-chief at this port, and Sir Isaac\r\nCoffin, of inspecting memory, the rear-admiral. One morning one of the\r\nmidshipmen, in stepping into the dockyard boat, had the misfortune to lose\r\nhis dirk overboard. As it was blowing strong, he could not return to the\r\nhulk to borrow another. He consequently went to the yard without one. The\r\nrear-admiral, who was always in search of adventure, met him. âHulloa!\r\nofficer,â said he; âwhy are you without side arms?â The youngster related\r\nwhat had happened. âThen, sir,â said he, âyou must buy another as fast as\r\nyou can.â âI have no money, sir,â replied the mid, âand I know no one\r\nhere.â âThen I will put you in the way to get one. Come with me to my\r\noffice.â The youngster followed him, and received the address of a sword\r\ncutler. âAnd tell him,â said Sir Isaac, âfrom me that you are to have a\r\ndirk. But,â added he, âI had better write my name; he will then know I\r\nsent you.â Next morning the mid lost no time in repairing to the shop of\r\nthe vendor of slaying instruments. He produced the rear-admiralâs paper.\r\nThe cutler at first hesitated. At length he said, âDo you pay for it?â\r\nâNo,â answered the mid, ânot till I return from my next cruise.â âOh,\r\nnever mind,â said the man of cut and thrust; âSir Isaac has signed the\r\npaper, and he will, of course, be responsible. What kind of dirk do you\r\nwish to have?â âOh, a good one,â returned the mid; âone at about forty\r\nshillings.â It was given him; he gave his name and ship, and left the\r\nshop. In a few days after this an order came on board from the admiral to\r\ndischarge a lieutenant and a midshipman into another ship bound to the\r\nWest Indies. The sixth lieutenant and this youngster were selected. About\r\nfour months afterwards the bill was sent to the rear-admiral for payment\r\nof the dirk. It was naturally refused. Some months passed, when the bill\r\nwas again presented and refused. The poor mid was far away and not\r\nforthcoming, although he fully intended, had he not been so suddenly\r\nexiled, to pay it when he was able. The cutler now brought an action\r\nagainst the rear-admiral, and he was, as he had put his name to the paper,\r\nobliged to pay the account.\r\n\r\nThe shipwrights and carpenters having repaired the ship, she was hauled\r\nalongside the hulk, and in ten days was as majestic as ever. Another\r\ncaptain was appointed, and I was ordered to join the _Diamond_ frigate, as\r\nfirst lieutenant, off Brest. I took an affectionate leave of my messmates,\r\nand procured a passage on board a passage-sloop going to Plymouth. We\r\nsailed in the evening, through the Needles passage, and when off the\r\nShingles the head of the mast went in the hounds. After much exertion we\r\ngot the main-sail out of the water, and the try-sail set. We reached, to\r\nmy great joy, Portland Roads on the third day, where, as I found myself\r\nrather queerish on board the sloop, I salaamed the skipper of her, and\r\nmounted a horse, which they assured me was quiet enough to carry the\r\nparson. With this assurance, which was corroborated by three old men and\r\ntwo young women, I trusted myself once more on a horseâs back. A brother\r\nofficer, who was also going to join a ship at Plymouth, accompanied me. We\r\ndined at Weymouth, saw Gloucester Lodge, had a somersault, to the terror\r\nand astonishment of the lady housekeeper and servants, on all the\r\nPrincessesâ beds, viewed the closet of odd-and-end old china belonging to\r\nthe amiable Princess Elizabeth, thought ourselves an inch taller when we\r\nsat ourselves down in the chair in which the good King dined at one\r\noâclock, generally off a boiled leg of mutton and turnips, so we were\r\ninformed, and in the evening hired a post-chaise and arrived at\r\nDorchester, where we took the mail for Plymouth. On reaching the latter\r\nplace we repaired to the admiralâs office, where, as there was no present\r\nopportunity of joining my new ship, I remained five days, calling on my\r\nold acquaintances and talking of old times.\r\n\r\nOne day we made an excursion to Plympton, and entered a neat farmerâs\r\nhouse. We inquired if we could be provided with some home-baked brown\r\nbread, and milk from the cow. The farmerâs wife, who was a hale, buxom,\r\nyoungish-looking woman, and had only nine children, brought out chairs and\r\nbenches. We had some madeira with us, and we made delicious whip-syllabub.\r\nThe nice, well-baked and wholesome brown loaves, with the milk and cream,\r\nwere too good for city aldermen, but quite good enough for sailors. We did\r\nample justice to the good wifeâs fare, of which she partook with her\r\nmother, who was sixty-five, and had eleven boys and nine girls all living.\r\nNine of the former were on board different men-of-war, and the other two\r\nworking with their father on the farm. âAnd,â added the poor woman, with\r\nan anxious, smiling face, âwhenever we see a squadron of Kingâs ships\r\narrive we expect a son.â The girls, with the exception of three who were\r\nmarried, were out in respectable families. We made a trifling purse, which\r\nwe gave to a fine boy about eleven years old for himself and brothers;\r\nrecompensed our good hostess, shook hands, and departed in peace and good\r\nfellowship.\r\n\r\nTwo days later I went on board the _Alexandria_ frigate for a passage to\r\nmy proper ship, which we fell in with soon afterwards off the Black Rocks.\r\nI found her a fine, first-class frigate, but, alas! I also found she only\r\nsailed like the launch, stern foremost. The captain, a jolly, little,\r\nfresh-faced, rather corpulent man, welcomed me with a smile, and after a\r\nshort conversation relating to the ship he inquired the news, on which I\r\npresented him with the latest newspaper. The surgeon, a delicate, pale\r\nyoung man, came up to me and asked me to the gun-room. On entering it he\r\nintroduced me to my future messmates. The second lieutenant was a\r\nfine-looking young man, highly connected, but unfortunately disgusted with\r\nthe Service, and too fond of a very strong north-wester, which soon\r\ndestroyed him, as he died a few months after I joined the frigate. The\r\nthird lieutenant was a person of great consequence in his own opinion, and\r\nalways imagined himself in the right. He was, nevertheless, an active\r\nofficer and knew his duty. The master was a hardy north countryman, and\r\nknew what he was about. The marine officer was a well-informed, sensible\r\nman; the mids were a fine set of lads, ripe for mischief and alert on\r\nduty. The shipâs company were, generally speaking, good and willing\r\nseamen, and I thought myself fortunate in being first lieutenant of such a\r\nship and of having intellectual messmates.\r\n\r\nWe were placed as one of the look-out frigates to watch the enemyâs\r\nvessels in Brest. The fleet was under the command of the brave and\r\npersevering Earl St. Vincent, whose laws were those of the Medes and\r\nPersians in days of yore. Implicit obedience and non-resistance was his\r\ndevice, and woe to those who were disobedient. My messmates gave me the\r\noutline of the captainâs character. They informed me he was more cut out\r\nfor a country gentleman than the captain of a man-of-war, that he was very\r\npartial to a good dinnerââShow me the man who is not,â interrupted I;âthat\r\nhe was highly nervous, and that he left everything to the first\r\nlieutenant, except the discipline of his cook. âSo be it,â cried I, âI\r\nthink we shall accord.â About ten days after being on board he sent for me\r\ninto his cabin. âNow,â said he to me, âMr. Hoffman, we have had time\r\nenough to know each other. I approve of your method of carrying on the\r\nduty, and from henceforth I shall consider you as sailing, and myself as\r\nfighting, captain.â I thanked him for the confidence he reposed in me, and\r\nassured him that, being very partial to the profession, I never was",

They light\r\nall the candles to give themselves courage, fall down on the floor, and\r\nbegin to scream as if some one were cutting their throats. And while\r\nthey are lying there squirming Khapun flies into the room in the shape\r\nof a great crow, and they all feel the cold wind of his wings blowing\r\nacross their hearts. The Jew whom Khapun has already spotted through\r\nthe window feels the devilâs claws sinking into his back. Ugh! It makes\r\noneâs flesh creep even to tell of it, so just think what the poor Jew\r\nmust feel! Of course he yells as loud as ever he can. But who can hear\r\nhim when all the rest of them are yelling like lunatics, too? And maybe\r\none of his neighbours does hear him, and is only glad it isnât himself\r\nwho is in such a sorry plight.\r\n\r\nKharko himself had heard more than once the pitiful, clear, long-drawn\r\nnotes of a trumpet floating out over the city. It was a novice in\r\nthe synagogue trumpeting out a farewell call to his unfortunate\r\nbrother, while the rest of the Jews were putting on their shoes in the\r\nentry--Jews always go into church in their stocking feet--or standing\r\nin little groups in the moonlight, whispering together on tip-toe,\r\nstaring up at the sky. And when the last man has gone, one lonely pair\r\nof shoes is left lying in the entry, waiting for its owner. Ah, those\r\nshoes will have to wait a long time, for at that very moment Khapun is\r\nflying with their owner high over woods and fields, over valleys and\r\nhills and plains, flapping his wings, and keeping well out of sight\r\nof Christian eyes. The accursed one is glad when the night is cloudy\r\nand dark. But when it is clear and still like to-night, with the moon\r\nshining as bright as day, the devilâs work may very well come to naught.\r\n\r\nâAnd why?â asked the miller, trembling lest the talkative Kharko should\r\nbegin poking insults at him again. But this time the servant answered\r\nquietly enough:\r\n\r\nâWell, you see, any Christian, no matter if heâs stupid, like you, can\r\ncall to the devil: âDrop it! It is mine!â and Khapun will drop the Jew\r\nat once. The devil will flutter his wings, and fly away with a shrill\r\ncry like a wounded hawk, to be left without prey for a year. The Jew\r\nwill fall to the ground. It will be lucky for him if he wasnât too high\r\nup and if he falls into a bog or some other soft spot. If he doesnât,\r\nno one will profit by his fall, neither he nor the devil.â\r\n\r\nâSo thatâs how it is!â said the miller, staring nervously at the sky,\r\nin which the moon was shining with all its might.

There isnât much wind now, and what there is isnât\r\ncoming from that quarter. Wait a minute, Philip, thereâs something\r\nqueer about this!â\r\n\r\nThe miller was very sleepy, but, nevertheless, he went out barefoot on\r\nto the dam, and stood in the middle of it scratching his chest and back\r\n(the mill was not free from fleas). A light breeze was blowing from\r\nthe mill-pond behind him, and yet there was that little cloud flying\r\ndirectly in his face. Only it now no longer looked feathery-light,\r\nneither did it fly as swiftly and freely as before. It seemed to be\r\nswaying a little and falling to earth like a wounded bird. As it flew\r\nacross the moon the miller at last saw very clearly what it was, for\r\nagainst that bright orb were silhouetted a pair of dark, flapping\r\nwings, and below them was hanging a human form with a long, quivering\r\nbeard.\r\n\r\nâAha, hereâs a pretty to do!â thought the miller. âHeâs carrying one of\r\nthem away. What shall I do? If I shout to him: drop it, it is mine! the\r\npoor Jew may break his neck or fall into the pond. Heâs pretty high up.â\r\n\r\nBut he soon saw that the situation was changing. The devil was circling\r\nover the mill with his burden, and beginning to sink to the ground.\r\n\r\nâHe was greedy and chose a morsel too big for him,â the miller said to\r\nhimself. âNow I can rescue the Jew; heâs a living soul, after all, and\r\nisnât to be compared to a devil. Come then, God bless me, let me shout\r\nmy loudest!â\r\n\r\nBut instead of shouting he strangely enough ran away from the dam as\r\nfast as his legs could carry him, and hid under the sycamores that\r\nstood like nixies at the edge of the mill-pond, bathing their green\r\nbranches in its dark water. The darkness was as deep under them as in\r\na barrel, and the miller felt sure that no one could see him. To tell\r\nthe honest truth, his teeth were chattering madly and his hands and\r\nfeet were trembling as the shafts trembled when his mill was running.\r\nNevertheless, he couldnât resist the temptation of peeping out to see\r\nwhat would happen next.\r\n\r\nFirst the devil fell almost to earth with his prey, and then rose again\r\nabove the tree-tops, but it was plain to see that his load was too\r\nheavy for him. Twice he actually touched the water, so that the ripples\r\nspread in circles from the Jewâs feet, but each time he flapped his\r\nwings, and rose again with his prey as a sea-gull rises from the water\r\nwith a heavy fish. At last, after circling about two or three times,\r\nthe devil fell heavily on to the dam, and lay as if dead, with the\r\nfainting Jew inanimate at his side.\r\n\r\nAnd I must tell you--I had nearly forgotten it--that our friend the\r\nmiller had long ago seen whom the Jewish Khapun had brought from the\r\ncity. And when he recognised him--need I conceal it when he has\r\nconfessed it himself?--he grew merry at heart and thought:\r\n\r\nâThank God, it is no other than our inn-keeper from Novokamensk! What\r\nhappens next is none of my business, because I donât think I ought to\r\ninterfere in other peopleâs affairs. When two dogs are fighting thereâs\r\nno reason a third should jump in. Again I say, let sleeping dogs lie.\r\nWhat if I hadnât have happened to be here? Iâm not the Jewâs guardian.â\r\n\r\nAnd he also thought:\r\n\r\nâAha, Philipko, now your time has come in Novokamensk!â\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nBoth the unfortunate Jew and the devil lay motionless on the dam for\r\na long time. The moon had begun to redden, and was hanging above the\r\ntree-tops as if only waiting to see what the end would be before\r\nsetting. A hoarse cock crowed in the village, and a dog yelped twice.",

Agreed. We have, with one consent, agreed, that in the parting\r\n  those particular proprieties which some of our friends and neighbors\r\n  have in Pawtuxet from the general common of our town of Providence,\r\n  to run upon a straight line upon a fresh spring, being in the gully\r\n  at the head of that cove, running by that point of land called\r\n  Sassafras, unto the town of Mashapaug, to an oak tree standing near\r\n  unto the corn-field, being at this time the nearest corn-field unto\r\n  Pawtuxet, the oak tree having four marks with an axe, till some\r\n  other landmark be set for a certain bound. Also we agree, that if\r\n  any meadow ground lying and joining to that meadow that borders upon\r\n  the river of Pawtuxet, come within the aforesaid line, which will\r\n  not come within a straight line from long cove to the marked tree,\r\n  then for that meadow to belong to Pawtuxet, and so beyond the town\r\n  of Mashapaug from the oak tree between the two fresh rivers Pawtuxet\r\n  and Wanasquatucket, of an even distance.\r\n\r\n  âII.

Agreed, that after many considerations and consultations of\r\n  our own State and also of other States abroad, in way of government,\r\n  we apprehend no way so suitable to our condition as government by\r\n  way of arbitration.

But if\r\n  these four men do not end it, then for the five disposers to choose\r\n  three men to put an end to it. And for the certainty hereof we agree\r\n  the major part of the five disposers to choose the three men, and\r\n  the major part of the three men to end the cause, having power from\r\n  the five disposers, by a note under their hand, to perform it; and\r\n  the faultive not agreeing in the first to pay the charge of the\r\n  last, and for the arbitrators to follow no employment until the\r\n  cause be ended, without consent of the whole that have to do with\r\n  the cause.\r\n\r\n  âInstance.

Agreed, that if any person damnify any man, either in goods or\r\n  good name, and the person offended follow not the cause upon the\r\n  offender, that if any person give notice to the five disposers, they\r\n  shall call the party delinquent to answer by arbitration.\r\n\r\n  âInstance. Thus, if any person abuse another in person or goods, may\r\n  be for peace sake a man will at present put it up, and it may so be\r\n  resolve to revenge: therefore, for the peace of the State, the\r\n  disposers are to look to it in the first place.\r\n\r\n  âV. Agreed, for all the whole inhabitants to combine ourselves to\r\n  assist any man in the pursuit of any party delinquent, with all our\r\n  best endeavors to attack him; but if any man raise a hubbub, and\r\n  there be no just cause, then for the party that raised the hubbub to\r\n  satisfy men for their time lost in it.\r\n\r\n  âVI. Agreed, that if any man have a difference with any of the five,\r\n  then he may have the clerk call the town together at his      for a\r\n  trial.\r\n\r\n  âInstance. It may be a man may be to depart the land, or to a far\r\n  part of the land, or his estate may lie upon a speedy trial, or the\r\n  like case may fall out.\r\n\r\n  âVII. Agreed, that the town, by five men, shall give every man a\r\n  deed of all his lands lying within the bounds of the plantation to\r\n  hold it by for after ages.\r\n\r\n  âVIII. Agreed, that the five disposers shall, from the date hereof,\r\n  meet every month day upon general things, and at the quarter day to\r\n  yield a new choice, and give up their old accounts.\r\n\r\n  âIX. Agreed, that the clerk shall call the five disposers together\r\n  at the month day, and the general town together every quarter, to\r\n  meet upon general occasions, from the date hereof.\r\n\r\n  âX. Agreed, that the clerk is to receive for every cause that comes\r\n  to the town for a trial, 4_d._; for making each deed, 12_d._; and to\r\n  give up the book to the town at the yearâs end, and yield to a new\r\n  choice.\r\n\r\n  âXI.

However, before many days passed her eunuch came\r\nto me, and I entreated him honourably and asked him after his mistress.\r\n\"Truly she is sick with love of thee,\" he replied and I rejoined, \"Tell\r\nme who and what she is.\" Quoth he, \"The Lady Zubaydah, queen consort of\r\nHarun al-Rashid, brought her up as a rearling[FN#560] and hath advanced\r\nher to be stewardess of the Harim, and gave her the right of going in\r\nand out of her own sweet will.

The mids declared they never would be\r\nrespectable enough to be called a band, but would be bad enough to be\r\ncalled a banditti, as they looked more like brigands than musicians.\r\n\r\nWe had nearly completed our water and stores, when I was ordered to the\r\ndockyard with the launch for the remainder and two anchor-stocks. It was\r\nblowing fresh, and in consequence I desired the leaves of the anchor-stock\r\nto be triced up under the oars outside the boat, that in case of shipping\r\na sea we might be able, if necessary, to cut them away. The last leaf was\r\nlowered down to the boat, when I felt a touch on my shoulder. I turned\r\nquickly round, when my nose, which is not very short, came in rude contact\r\nwith a cocked hat, which it nearly knocked off the head of the wearer. It\r\nwas the admiral, who was in stature a King Johnâs man, four feet nothing.\r\nI immediately pulled off my hat and apologised. âWhat are you doing, sir,â\r\nsaid he to me, âwith these anchor-stocks?â âTricing them up outside the\r\nboat, sir,â replied I. âWhy do you not boat them?â I explained my reasons\r\nfor not doing so.

On the 8th January field orders were published constituting the\r\n10th Brigade of the 5th Division a Corps Brigade, and placing the\r\n4th Brigade in the 5th Division. The 5th Division thus constituted\r\nmarched from Frere on the 10th instant, arriving at Springfield on\r\nthe 12th instant.\r\n\r\n2. On the 15th January I received your secret instructions to command\r\na force to proceed across the Tugela, near Trichardtâs Drift, to the\r\nwest of Spion Kop, recommending me to proceed forward refusing my\r\nright (namely, Spion Kop), and bringing my left forward to gain the\r\nopen plain north of Spion Kop. This move was to commence as soon as\r\nsupplies were all in, and the 10th Brigade (except two companies)\r\nremoved from Springfield Bridge to Spearmanâs Hill.\r\n\r\n3. I was provided with 4 daysâ rations, with which I was to cross\r\nthe Tugela, fight my way round to north of Spion Kop, and join your\r\ncolumn opposite Potgieterâs.\r\n\r\n4. On the 15th January I made the arrangements for getting supplies,\r\nand moved the 10th Brigade on the following day; and on the evening\r\nof the 16th January I left Springfield with a force under my\r\ncommand, which amounted to an Army Corps (less one brigade), and by a\r\nnight march arrived at Trichardtâs Drift, and took possession of the\r\nhills on the south side of the Tugela.\r\n\r\n5. On the 17th January I threw pontoon bridges across the Tugela,\r\npassed the infantry across by ponts, and captured the hills\r\nimmediately commanding the drift on the north side with two brigades\r\ncommanded by Generals Woodgate and Hart. The Commander-in-Chief was\r\npresent during part of the day, and gave some verbal directions to\r\nGeneral Woodgate.\r\n\r\nThe Mounted Brigade passed over principally by the drift, and went\r\nover the country as far as Acton Homes, and on the following day\r\n(18th) had a successful action with a small party of Boers, bringing\r\nin 31 prisoners.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 17th, and day of the 18th, the whole of the\r\nwagons belonging to the force were brought across the Tugela, and the\r\nartillery were in position outside of Wrightâs Farm.\r\n\r\n6. On the 19th two brigades advanced, occupying the slopes of the\r\nadjoining hills on the right, and the wagons were successfully\r\nbrought to Venterâs Spruit.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, after having examined the possible roads by which\r\nwe could proceed, I assembled the General Officers and the Staff,",

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n",

I suggested that as General Coke was still lame from the effects\r\nof a lately broken leg, General Woodgate, who had two sound legs, was\r\nbetter adapted for mountain climbing.\r\n\r\n4. As no heliograph could, on account of the fire, be kept on the\r\neast side of Spion Kop, messages for Sir C. Warren were received by\r\nour signallers at Spearman, and telegraphed to Sir C. Warren; thus I\r\nsaw them before he did, as I was at the signal station. The telegram\r\nSir C. Warren quotes did not give me confidence in its sender, and,\r\nat the moment, I could see that our men on the top had given way, and\r\nthat efforts were being made to rally them.

    "report45.txt": "\r\n\r\nWatkins emerged from the cabin with the tools and the expression of a\r\nmartyr.  Nikka insisted that he was the best climber in the party,\r\nand took charge of the rope.  Hugh and I carried the crowbars, which\r\nwe wrapped in sailcloth to prevent their clinking against the stones\r\nof the wall.  Then we stepped on to the slimy rocks of the jetty,\r\nNikka in the lead.\r\n\r\nIt was a perilous climb to the shore, and we negotiated it slowly,\r\nhelping one another and taking every precaution to avoid making any\r\nnoise.  At last we found ourselves in the jumble of bowlders\r\nconstituting the breakwater at the foot of the sea-wall, which reared\r\nits moss-grown battlements high overhead.  We turned to the left\r\nhere, and crawled over and through the rocks on the beach to a point\r\nunder the overhanging wall of the House of the Married.  From the\r\nbeach it looked unclimbable, but Nikka, after surveying its mounting\r\ncourses, shattered and riven by centuries of neglect, by earthquakes\r\nand the ceaseless battering of the waves, removed his shoes and\r\nstarted the ascent, an end of the grapnel-rope looped around his\r\nwaist.\r\n\r\nWe who watched him stood with knocking hearts for what seemed an\r\neternity.  Spread-eagled against the wall, he appeared as\r\ninfinitesimal as a fly in the darkness.  At first we could see him\r\nwhen he slipped and caught himself or sprawled or clutched for\r\nhandholds.  But soon he became an indistinct blotch on the masonry,\r\nand we held our breath, helpless now to aid him.  Our first knowledge\r\nthat he had succeeded came when he jerked up the grapnel lying on the\r\nbeach at our feet.  He hoisted it slowly, lest it clash against the\r\nwall, adjusted its prongs and tossed down the knotted length of rope.\r\n\r\nHugh followed him with ease, bracing his feet against the wall when\r\nhe was tired.  Then I went up.  Then my uncle.  Watkins came last.\r\nWe stood, bending low, on the seaward verge of the roof over which\r\nNikka and I had fled the previous night.  It was now well towards\r\nmidnight, and a haze was settling over the city.  The _Curlew_ was\r\ninvisible even to us who knew precisely her location.  The large\r\ncourtyard to our right was a mere blot; the Garden of the Cedars in\r\nfront of us was marked by the whispering tops of its two trees.  The\r\nsilence was absolute.  The water lapped on the beach below.  That was\r\nall.\r\n\r\nNaturally and by right, Hugh took command.  It was his expedition.\r\n\r\n\"Do we go down through the trapdoor Jack and Nikka used or do we use\r\nthe rope to drop directly into the Garden?\" he asked.\r\n",

Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.

I could mention sundry names at Cairo whose charming owners\r\nhave done worse things than this unseemly frolic.\r\n\r\n[FN#650] Arab. \"Shayyun li'llÃ¡hi,\" a beggar's formula = per amor di\r\nDio.\r\n\r\n[FN#651] Noting how sharp-eared the blind become.\r\n\r\n[FN#652] The blind in Egypt are notorious for insolence and violence,\r\nfanaticism and rapacity. Not a few foreigners have suffered from them\r\n(Pilgrimage i., 148). In former times many were blinded in infancy by\r\ntheir mothers, and others blinded themselves to escape conscription or\r\nhonest hard work. They could always obtain food, especially as\r\nMu'ezzins and were preferred because they could not take advantage of\r\nthe minaret by spying into their neighbours' households. The Egyptian\r\nrace is chronically weak-eyed, the effect of the damp hot climate of\r\nthe valley, where ophthalmia prevailed even during the pre-Pharaohnic\r\ndays. The great Sesostris died stone-blind and his successor lost his\r\nsight for ten years (Pilgrimage ii., 176). That the Fellahs are now\r\ncongenitally weak-eyed, may be seen by comparing them with negroes\r\nimported from Central Africa. Ophthalmia rages, especially during the\r\ndamp season, in the lower Nile-valley; and the best cure for it is a\r\nfortnight's trip to the Desert where, despite glare, sand and wind, the\r\neye readily recovers tone.\r\n\r\n[FN#653] i.e., with kicks and cuffs and blows, as is the custom.\r\n\r\n(Pilgrimage i., 174.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[FN#654] Arab.

It is always\r\nunlucky to meet a one-eyed man, especially the first thing in the\r\nmorning and when setting out on any errand. The idea is that the\r\nfascinated one will suffer from some action of the physical eye.\r\nMonoculars also are held to be rogues: so the Sanskrit saying \"Few\r\none-eyed men be honest men.\"\r\n\r\n[FN#659] Al-NashshÃ¡r from Nashr = sawing: so the fiddler in Italian is\r\ncalled the \"village-saw\" (Sega del villaggio). He is the Alnaschar of\r\nthe Englished Galland and Richardson. The tale is very old. It appears\r\nas the Brahman and the Pot of Rice in the Panchatantra; and Professor\r\nBenfey believes (as usual with him) that this, with many others,\r\nderives from a Buddhist source. But I would distinctly derive it from\r\nÃsop's market-woman who kicked over her eggs, whence the Lat. prov.\r\nAnte victoriam canere triumphum = to sell the skin before you have\r\ncaught the bear.

See M. Max Muller's \"Chips,\" (vol. iii., appendix) The\r\ncurious reader will compare my version with that which appears at the\r\nend of Richardson's Arabic Grammar (Edit. Of 1811): he had a better, or\r\nrather a fuller MS.

It is one of the many\r\nsynonyms for a pimp, and a word in general use (Pilgrimage i., 276).The\r\nmost insulting term, like DayyÃºs, insinuates that the man panders for\r\nhis own wife.\r\n\r\n[FN#670] Of hands and face, etc. See Night cccclxiv.\r\n\r\n[FN#671] Arab. \"Sadakah\" (sincerity), voluntary or superogatory alms,\r\nopposed to \"ZakÃ¡t\" (purification), legal alms which are indispensable.\r\n\"Prayer carries us half way to Allah, fasting brings us to the door of\r\nHis palace and alms deeds (Sadakah) cause us to enter.\" For \"ZakÃ¡t\" no\r\nespecial rate is fixed, but it should not be less than one-fortieth of\r\nproperty or two and a half per cent. Thus Al-lslam is, as far as I\r\nknow, the only faith which makes a poor-rate (ZakÃ¡t) obligatory and\r\nwhich has invented a property-tax, as opposed the unjust and unfair\r\nincome-tax upon which England prides herself.\r\n\r\n[FN#672] A Greek girl.\r\n\r\n[FN#673] This was making himself very easy; and the idea is the gold in\r\nthe pouch caused him to be so bold. Lane's explanation (in loco) is all\r\nwrong. The pride engendered by sudden possession of money is a lieu\r\ncommun amongst Eastern story tellers; even in the beast-fables the\r\nmouse which has stolen a few gold pieces becomes confident and\r\nstout-hearted.\r\n\r\n[FN#674] Arab. \"al-MÃ¡lihah\" also means the beautiful (fem.) from\r\nMilh=salt, splendour, etc., the Mac edit. has \"Mumallihah\" = a\r\nsalt-vessel.\r\n\r\n[FN#675] i.e., to see if he felt the smart.\r\n\r\n[FN#676] Arab. \"SardÃ¡beh\" (Persian)=an underground room used for\r\ncoolness in the hot season. It is unknown in Cairo but every house in\r\nBaghdad, in fact throughout the Mesopotamian cities, has one. It is on\r\nthe principle of the underground cellar without which wine will not\r\nkeep: Lane (i., 406) calls it a \"vault\".\r\n\r\n[FN#677] In the orig. \"O old woman!\" which is insulting.\r\n\r\n[FN#678] So the Italians say \"a quail to skin.\"\r\n\r\n[FN#679] \"Amen\" is the word used for quarter on the battle-field; and\r\nthere are Joe Millers about our soldiers in India mistaking it for \"a\r\nman\" or (Scottice) \"a mon.\"\r\n\r\n[FN#680] Illustrating the Persian saying \"Allah himself cannot help a\r\nfool.\"\r\n\r\n[FN#681] Any article taken from the person and given to a criminal is a\r\npromise of pardon, of course on the implied condition of plenary\r\nconfession and of becoming \"King's evidence.\"\r\n\r\n[FN#682] A naÃ¯ve proposal to share the plunder.\r\n\r\n[FN#683] In popular literature \"Schacabac.\", And from this tale comes\r\nour saying \"A Barmecide's Feast,\" i.e., an illusion.\r\n\r\n[FN#684] The Castrato at the door is still (I have said) the fashion of\r\nCairo and he acts \"Suisse\" with a witness.\r\n\r\n[FN#685] As usual in the East, the mansion was a hollow square\r\nsurrounding what in Spain is called Patio: the outer entrance was far\r\nfrom the inner, showing the extent of the grounds.\r\n\r\n[FN#686] \"Nahnu mÃ¡lihÃ­n\" = we are on terms of salt, said and say the\r\nArabs. But the traveller must not trust in these days to the once\r\nsacred tie; there are tribes which will give bread with one hand and\r\nstab with the other. The Eastern use of salt is a curious contrast with\r\nthat of Westerns, who made it an invidious and inhospitable\r\ndistinction, e.g., to sit above the salt-cellar and below the salt.\r\nAmongst the ancients, however, \"he took bread and salt\" means he swore,\r\nthe food being eaten when an oath was taken. Hence the \"Bride cake\" of\r\nsalt, water and flour.\r\n\r\n[FN#687] Arab. \"HarÃ­sah,\" the meat-pudding before explained.\r\n\r\n[FN#688] Arab. \"SikbÃ¡j,\" before explained; it is held to be a lordly\r\ndish, invented by Khusraw Parwiz. \"Fatted duck\" says the Bresl.

Had this been known to our\r\ncavalry when we first occupied Egypt in 1883-4 our losses in\r\nhorse-flesh would have been far less; but official ignorance persisted\r\nin feeding the cattle upon heating oats and the riders upon beef, which\r\nis indigestible, instead of mutton, which is wholesome.\r\n\r\n[FN#691] i.e. \"I conjure thee by God.\"\r\n\r\n[FN#692] i.e. \"This is the very thing for thee.\"\r\n\r\n[FN#693] i.e., at random.\r\n\r\n[FN#694] This is the way of slaughtering the camel, whose throat is\r\nnever cut on account of the thickness of the muscles. \"Ãgorger un\r\nchameau\" is a mistake often made in French books.\r\n\r\n[FN#695] i.e. I will break bounds.\r\n\r\n[FN#696] The Arabs have a saying corresponding with the dictum of the\r\nSalernitan school:â\r\n\r\n     Noscitur a labiis quantum sit virginis antrum:\r\n\r\n     Noscitur a naso quanta sit haste viro;\r\n\r\n     (A maiden's mouth shows what's the make of her chose;\r\n\r\n     And man's mentule one knows by the length of his nose.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereto I would add:â\r\n\r\n     And the eyebrows disclose how the lower wig grows.\r\n\r\nThe observations are purely empirical but, as far as my experience\r\nextends, correct.\r\n\r\n[FN#697] Arab. \"Kahkahah,\" a very low proceeding.\r\n\r\n[FN#698] Or \"for every death there is a cause;\" but the older\r\n\r\nArabs had a saying corresponding with \"Deus non fecit mortem.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[FN#699] The King's barber is usually a man of rank for the best of\r\nreasons, that he holds his Sovereign's life between his fingers.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\r\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\r\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and\r\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n\r\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n    Chief Executive and Director\r\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "report9.txt": "information, despatches from General Sir Redvers Buller, describing\r\nthe advance across the Tugela River on the 17th and 18th January,\r\n1900, and the capture and evacuation of the Spion Kop position on the\r\n23rd and 24th January, as well as certain minor operations between\r\nthe 19th and 24th January on the right or eastern line of advance.\r\n\r\n2. The plan of operations is not very clearly described in the\r\ndespatches themselves, but it may be gathered from them and the\r\naccompanying documents themselves that the original intention was\r\nto cross the Tugela at or near Trichardâs Drift, and thence by\r\nfollowing the road past âFair Viewâ and âActon Homes,â to gain\r\nthe open plain north of Spion Kop, the Boer position in front of\r\nPotgieterâs Drift being too strong to be taken by direct attack.\r\nThe whole force, less one brigade, was placed under the orders of\r\nSir Charles Warren, who, the day after he had crossed the Tugela,\r\nseems to have consulted his General and principal Staff Officers,\r\nand to have come to the conclusion that the flanking movement\r\nwhich Sir Redvers Buller had mentioned in his secret instructions\r\nwas impracticable on account of the insufficiency of supplies. He\r\naccordingly decided to advance by the more direct road leading\r\nnorth-east, and branching off from a point east of âThree Tree Hill.â\r\nThe selection of this road necessitated the capture and retention\r\nof Spion Kop, but whether it would have been equally necessary to\r\noccupy Spion Kop, had the line of advance indicated by Sir Redvers\r\nBuller been followed, is not stated in the correspondence. As Sir\r\nCharles Warren considered it impossible to make the wide flanking\r\nmovement which was recommended, if not actually prescribed, in his\r\nsecret instructions, he should at once have acquainted Sir Redvers\r\nBuller with the course of action which he proposed to adopt. There\r\nis nothing to show whether he did so or not, but it seems only fair\r\nto Sir Charles Warren to point out that Sir Redvers Buller appears\r\nthroughout to have been aware of what was happening. On several\r\noccasions he was present during the operations. He repeatedly gave\r\nadvice to his subordinate commander, and on the day after the\r\nwithdrawal from Spion Kop he resumed the chief command.\r\n\r\n      {{3. In his note[9] on Sir Charles Warrenâs report,\r\n      accompanying despatch of 30th January 1900,[10] Sir\r\n      Redvers Buller expresses a very adverse opinion on the\r\n      manner in which Sir Charles Warren carried out the\r\n      instructions he had received. Without a knowledge of the\r\n      country and circumstances it is difficult to say whether\r\n      the delay, misdirection, and want of control, of which\r\n      Sir Redvers Buller complains, were altogether avoidable;\r\n      but, in any case, if he considered that his orders were\r\n      not being properly given effect to, it appears to me\r\n      that it was his duty to intervene as soon as he had\r\n      reason to believe that the success of the operations\r\n      was being endangered. This, indeed, is admitted by\r\n      Sir Redvers Buller himself, whose explanation of his\r\n      non-interference can hardly be accepted as adequate. A\r\n      most important enterprise was being attempted, and no\r\n      personal considerations should have deterred the officer\r\n      in chief command from insisting on its being conducted\r\n      in the manner which, in his opinion, would lead to the\r\n      attainment of the object in view, with the least possible\r\n      loss on our side.}}\r\n\r\nAs regards the withdrawal of the troops from the Spion Kop position,\r\nwhich, though occupied almost without opposition in the early\r\nmorning of the 24th January, had to be held throughout the day under\r\nan extremely heavy fire, and the retention of which had become\r\nessential to the relief of Ladysmith, I regret that I am unable\r\nto concur with Sir Redvers Buller in thinking that Lieut.-Colonel\r\nThorneycroft exercised a wise discretion in ordering the troops to\r\nretire. Even admitting that due preparations may not have been made\r\nfor strengthening the position during the night, reorganising the\r\ndefence, and bringing up artillery--in regard to which Sir Charles\r\nWarrenâs report does not altogether bear out Sir Redvers Bullerâs\r\ncontention--admitting also that the senior officers on the summit of\r\nthe hill might have been more promptly informed of the measures taken\r\nby Sir Charles Warren to support and reinforce them, I am of opinion\r\nthat Lieut.-Colonel Thorneycroftâs assumption of responsibility and\r\nauthority was wholly inexcusable. During the night the enemyâs fire,\r\nif it did not cease altogether, could not have been formidable, and,\r\nthough lamp signalling was not possible at the time, owing to the\r\nsupply of oil having failed, it would not have taken more than two or\r\nthree hours at most for Lieut.-Colonel Thorneycroft to communicate\r\nby messenger with Major-General Coke or Sir Charles Warren, and to\r\nreceive a reply. Major-General Coke appears to have left Spion Kop at\r\n9.30 P.M. for the purpose of consulting with Sir Charles Warren, and\r\nup to that hour the idea of a withdrawal had not been entertained.\r\nYet almost immediately after Major-General Cokeâs departure\r\nLieut.-Colonel Thorneycroft issued an order, without reference to\r\nsuperior authority, which upset the whole plan of operations, and\r\nrendered unavailing the sacrifices which had already been made to\r\ncarry it into effect.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is only right to state that Lieut.-Colonel\r\nThorneycroft appears to have behaved in a very gallant manner\r\nthroughout the day, and it was doubtless due, in a great measure,\r\nto his exertions and example that the troops continued to hold the\r\nsummit of the hill until directed to retire.\r\n\r\n5. The conduct of Captain Phillips, Brigade-Major of the 10th\r\nBrigade, on the occasion in question, is deserving of high\r\ncommendation. He did his best to rectify the mistake which was\r\nbeing made, but it was too late. Signalling communication was not\r\nre-established until 2.30 A.M. on the 25th January, and by that time\r\nthe naval guns could not have reached the summit of the hill before\r\ndaybreak. Major-General Coke did not return, and Lieut.-Colonel"
