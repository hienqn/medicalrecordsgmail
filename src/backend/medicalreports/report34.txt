the first week in August, 1633,
  (Providence Records) and Mr. Cotton, who arrived at Boston the fourth
  of September following, says, he had removed into the Bay before his
  arrival.” (Tenet Washed, part 2, p. 4.) It is certain, from Winthrop’s
  Journal, vol. i. p. 117, that Mr. Williams had returned to Salem
  previously to November, 1633, for under that date Winthrop says, that
  he “was removed from Plymouth thither, (but not in any office, though
  he exercised by way of prophecy).” The expression implies, that he had
  _recently_ removed, and this agrees with the supposition that he
  returned to Salem in August.

Footnote 63:

  Mr. Skelton’s name is first mentioned by Winthrop, and Dr. Bentley (1
  His. Col. vi. p. 248) attributes to Mr. Skelton the open opposition.

Footnote 64:

  “Perhaps,” says Mr. Savage, “the same expressions from another would
  have given less offence. From Williams they were not at first received
  in the mildest, or even the most natural sense; though further
  reflection satisfied the magistrates that his were not dangerous. The
  passages from the Apocalypse were probably not _applied_ to the honor
  of the King; and I regret, therefore, that Winthrop did not preserve
  them.”
