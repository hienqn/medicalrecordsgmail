were at liberty to go nearly as far as the nearest Spanish fort. It was a
singular coincidence to see us shaking hands and offering cigars to men
whose duty it was an hour before to shoot us. Everything went off very
pleasantly except with the poor, distressed horses, who had to run over
deep sand. After the Spanish Governor and his officers had partaken of a
plentiful collation under a large marquee, they took their departure, and
we gave them three cheers. We at length received our rudder from the hands
of the dockyard mateys. They had made a good job of it, and it answered
admirably.
