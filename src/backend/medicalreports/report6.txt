[FN#649] Meaning that the trick had been played by the Wazir's wife or
daughter. I could mention sundry names at Cairo whose charming owners
have done worse things than this unseemly frolic.

[FN#650] Arab. "Shayyun li'lláhi," a beggar's formula = per amor di
Dio.

[FN#651] Noting how sharp-eared the blind become.

[FN#652] The blind in Egypt are notorious for insolence and violence,
fanaticism and rapacity. Not a few foreigners have suffered from them
(Pilgrimage i., 148). In former times many were blinded in infancy by
their mothers, and others blinded themselves to escape conscription or
honest hard work. They could always obtain food, especially as
Mu'ezzins and were preferred because they could not take advantage of
the minaret by spying into their neighbours' households. The Egyptian
race is chronically weak-eyed, the effect of the damp hot climate of
the valley, where ophthalmia prevailed even during the pre-Pharaohnic
days. The great Sesostris died stone-blind and his successor lost his
sight for ten years (Pilgrimage ii., 176). That the Fellahs are now
congenitally weak-eyed, may be seen by comparing them with negroes
imported from Central Africa. Ophthalmia rages, especially during the
damp season, in the lower Nile-valley; and the best cure for it is a
fortnight's trip to the Desert where, despite glare, sand and wind, the
eye readily recovers tone.

[FN#653] i.e., with kicks and cuffs and blows, as is the custom.

(Pilgrimage i., 174.)


[FN#654] Arab. Káid (whence "Alcayde") a word still much used in

North Western Africa.


[FN#655] Arab. "Sullam" = lit. a ladder; a frame-work of sticks, used
by way of our triangles or whipping-posts.

[FN#656] This is one of the feats of Al-Símiyá = white magic;
fascinating the eyes. In Europe it has lately taken the name of
"Electro-biology."

[FN#657] again by means of the "Símiyá" or power of fascination
possessed by the old scoundrel.

[FN#658] A formula for averting "Al-Ayn," the evil eye. It is always
unlucky to meet a one-eyed man, especially the first thing in the
morning and when setting out on any errand. The idea is that the
fascinated one will suffer from some action of the physical eye.
Monoculars also are held to be rogues: so the Sanskrit saying "Few
one-eyed men be honest men."

[FN#659] Al-Nashshár from Nashr = sawing: so the fiddler in Italian is
called the "village-saw" (Sega del villaggio). He is the Alnaschar of
the Englished Galland and Richardson. The tale is very old. It appears
as the Brahman and the Pot of Rice in the Panchatantra; and Professor
Benfey believes (as usual with him) that this, with many others,
derives from a Buddhist source. But I would distinctly derive it from
Æsop's market-woman who kicked over her eggs, whence the Lat. prov.
Ante victoriam canere triumphum = to sell the skin before you have
caught the bear. In the "Kalilah and Dimnah" and its numerous offspring
it is the "Ascetic with his Jar of oil and honey;" in Rabelais (i., 33)
Echephron's shoemaker spills his milk, and so La Perette in La
Fontaine. See M. Max Muller's "Chips," (vol. iii., appendix) The
curious reader will compare my version with that which appears at the
end of Richardson's Arabic Grammar (Edit. Of 1811): he had a better, or
rather a fuller MS. (p. 199) than any yet printed.

[FN#660] Arab. "Atr" = any perfume, especially oil of roses; whence our
word "Otter,' through the Turkish corruption.

[FN#661] The texts give "dirhams" (100,000 = 5,000 dinars) for
"dinars," a clerical error as the sequel shows.

[FN#662] "Young slaves," says Richardson, losing "colour."

[FN#663] Nothing more calculated to give affront than such a refusal.
Richardson (p. 204) who, however, doubts his own version (p. 208), here
translates, "and I will not give liberty to my soul (spouse) but in her
apartments." The Arabic, or rather Cairene, is, "wa lá akhalli rúhi" I
will not let myself go, i.e., be my everyday self, etc.

[FN#664] "Whilst she is in astonishment and terror."

(Richardson.)


[FN#665] "Chamber of robes," Richardson, whose text has "Nám" for

"Manám."


[FN#666] "Till I compleat her distress," Richardson, whose text is
corrupt.

[FN#667] "Sleep by her side," R. the word "Name" bearing both senses.

[FN#668] "Will take my hand," R. "takabbal" being also ambiguous.

[FN#669] Arab. "Mu'arras" one who brings about "'Ars," marriages, etc.
So the Germ. = "Kupplerinn" a Coupleress. It is one of the many
synonyms for a pimp, and a word in general use (Pilgrimage i., 276).The
most insulting term, like Dayyús, insinuates that the man panders for
his own wife.

[FN#670] Of hands and face, etc. See Night cccclxiv.

[FN#671] Arab. "Sadakah" (sincerity), voluntary or superogatory alms,
opposed to "Zakát" (purification), legal alms which are indispensable.
"Prayer carries us half way to Allah, fasting brings us to the door of
His palace and alms deeds (Sadakah) cause us to enter." For "Zakát" no
especial rate is fixed, but it should not be less than one-fortieth of
property or two and a half per cent. Thus Al-lslam is, as far as I
know, the only faith which makes a poor-rate (Zakát) obligatory and
which has invented a property-tax, as opposed the unjust and unfair
income-tax upon which England prides herself.

[FN#672] A Greek girl.

[FN#673] This was making himself very easy; and the idea is the gold in
the pouch caused him to be so bold. Lane's explanation (in loco) is all
wrong. The pride engendered by sudden possession of money is a lieu
commun amongst Eastern story tellers; even in the beast-fables the
mouse which has stolen a few gold pieces becomes confident and
stout-hearted.

[FN#674] Arab. "al-Málihah" also means the beautiful (fem.) from
Milh=salt, splendour, etc., the Mac edit. has "Mumallihah" = a
salt-vessel.

[FN#675] i.e., to see if he felt the smart.

[FN#676] Arab. "Sardábeh" (Persian)=an underground room used for
coolness in the hot season. It is unknown in Cairo but every house in
Baghdad, in fact throughout the Mesopotamian cities, has one. It is on
the principle of the underground cellar without which wine will not
keep: Lane (i., 406) calls it a "vault".

[FN#677] In the orig. "O old woman!" which is insulting.

[FN#678] So the Italians say "a quail to skin."

[FN#679] "Amen" is the word used for quarter on the battle-field; and
there are Joe Millers about our soldiers in India mistaking it for "a
man" or (Scottice) "a mon."

[FN#680] Illustrating the Persian saying "Allah himself cannot help a
fool."

[FN#681] Any article taken from the person and given to a criminal is a
promise of pardon, of course on the implied condition of plenary
confession and of becoming "King's evidence."

[FN#682] A naïve proposal to share the plunder.

[FN#683] In popular literature "Schacabac.", And from this tale comes
our saying "A Barmecide's Feast," i.e., an illusion.

[FN#684] The Castrato at the door is still (I have said) the fashion of
Cairo and he acts "Suisse" with a witness.

[FN#685] As usual in the East, the mansion was a hollow square
surrounding what in Spain is called Patio: the outer entrance was far
from the inner, showing the extent of the grounds.

[FN#686] "Nahnu málihín" = we are on terms of salt, said and say the
Arabs. But the traveller must not trust in these days to the once
sacred tie; there are tribes which will give bread with one hand and
stab with the other. The Eastern use of salt is a curious contrast with
that of Westerns, who made it an invidious and inhospitable
distinction, e.g., to sit above the salt-cellar and below the salt.
Amongst the ancients, however, "he took bread and salt" means he swore,
the food being eaten when an oath was taken. Hence the "Bride cake" of
salt, water and flour.

[FN#687] Arab. "Harísah," the meat-pudding before explained.

[FN#688] Arab. "Sikbáj," before explained; it is held to be a lordly
dish, invented by Khusraw Parwiz. "Fatted duck" says the Bresl. Edit.
ii., 308, with more reason.

[FN#689] I was reproved in Southern Abyssinia for eating without this
champing, "Thou feedest like a beggar who muncheth silently in his
corner;" and presently found that it was a sign of good breeding to eat
as noisily as possible.

[FN#690] Barley in Arabia is, like our oats, food for horses: it
fattens at the same time that it cools them. Had this been known to our
cavalry when we first occupied Egypt in 1883-4 our losses in
horse-flesh would have been far less; but official ignorance persisted
in feeding the cattle upon heating oats and the riders upon beef, which
is indigestible, instead of mutton, which is wholesome.

[FN#691] i.e. "I conjure thee by God."

[FN#692] i.e. "This is the very thing for thee."

[FN#693] i.e., at random.

[FN#694] This is the way of slaughtering the camel, whose throat is
never cut on account of the thickness of the muscles. "Égorger un
chameau" is a mistake often made in French books.

[FN#695] i.e. I will break bounds.

[FN#696] The Arabs have a saying corresponding with the dictum of the
Salernitan school:—

     Noscitur a labiis quantum sit virginis antrum:

     Noscitur a naso quanta sit haste viro;

     (A maiden's mouth shows what's the make of her chose;

     And man's mentule one knows by the length of his nose.)


Whereto I would add:—

     And the eyebrows disclose how the lower wig grows.

The observations are purely empirical but, as far as my experience
extends, correct.

[FN#697] Arab. "Kahkahah," a very low proceeding.

[FN#698] Or "for every death there is a cause;" but the older

Arabs had a saying corresponding with "Deus non fecit mortem."


[FN#699] The King's barber is usually a man of rank for the best of
reasons, that he holds his Sovereign's life between his fingers. One of
these noble Figaros in India married an English lady who was, they say,
unpleasantly surprised to find out what were her husband's official
duties.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
