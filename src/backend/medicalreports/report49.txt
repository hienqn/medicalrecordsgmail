suffered her to dye his eyebrows and
pluck out his mustachios, after which the maiden returned to her
mistress and told her. Quoth she "Remaineth now only one other thing to
be done; thou must shave his beard and make him a smooth o'
face."[FN#646] So the maiden went back and told him what her mistress
had bidden her do; and my brother (the blockhead!) said to her, "How
shall I do what will disgrace me before the folk?" But the old woman
said, "She would do on this wise only that thou mayst be as a beardless
youth and that no hair be left on thy face to scratch and prick her
delicate cheeks; for indeed she is passionately in love with thee. So
be patient and thou shalt attain thine object." My brother was patient
and did her bidding and let shave off his beard and, when he was
brought back to the lady, lo! he appeared dyed red as to his eyebrows,
plucked of both mustachios, shorn of his beard, rouged on both cheeks.
